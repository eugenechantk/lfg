name: lfg-sessions
description: See and drive the other lfg Codex sessions — list them, read what a session is doing, send it instructions, interrupt it, start/stop one, and track which session is currently in focus. Use whenever the user (especially over voice) refers to "my session", "the coding agent", "what is X working on", "tell it to…", "switch to…", or otherwise wants to manage work across sessions.

# Driving lfg sessions

You are running inside lfg and can orchestrate the other Codex sessions it
manages, over its local HTTP API. The API is on the same box, unauthenticated:

```
BASE=http://localhost:8766
```

Each session has a stable `sessionId` (UUID) and a human `title`. Work in terms of
the title with the user ("the auth session", "the one fixing billing"); resolve it
to a `sessionId` via the list. **Speak results in one short conversational line** —
you're being read aloud.

## Which session are we working on (focus pointer)

Persist the focused session so it survives across turns:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.lfg
echo "<sessionId>" > ~/.lfg/active-session   # set focus
cat ~/.lfg/active-session 2>/dev/null         # recall focus
```

When the user names or implies a session ("let's work on the auth one"), resolve it
and write it to the pointer. When they say "it" / "that session" without naming one,
use the pointer. If the pointer is empty and it's ambiguous, list sessions and ask
which one (briefly).

## Capabilities

```bash
# List sessions. Only act on entries that have both sessionId and tmuxTarget.
curl -s $BASE/api/sessions | jq '.sessions[] | {sessionId, title, agent, tmuxName, tmuxTarget, assignedUser, lastUserText, lastActivityAt}'

# Read the full normalized transcript for context/history questions
curl -s "$BASE/api/sessions/<id>/messages?full=1" | jq -r '.messages[] | "\(.role)/\(.kind): \(.text)"'

# Quick status read only (recent tail)
curl -s "$BASE/api/sessions/<id>/messages?limit=20" | jq -r '.messages[] | "\(.role)/\(.kind): \(.text)"'

# Send an instruction / steer a session (queued; delivered when it's ready)
curl -s -X POST $BASE/api/sessions/<id>/send -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"text":"run the tests and report failures"}'

# Interrupt a session's current turn (Escape — stop / redirect it)
curl -s -X POST $BASE/api/sessions/<id>/interrupt

# Check delivery status of things you sent
curl -s $BASE/api/sessions/<id>/queue | jq '.queue'

# Start a new worker session (defaults to the configured repo; pass cwd to change)
curl -s -X POST $BASE/api/sessions/new -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"prompt":"investigate the failing deploy"}' | jq '{sessionId, tmuxName}'

# Close a session you started
curl -s -X POST $BASE/api/sessions/<id>/close
```

## Workflow

1. **Resolve** the target: focus pointer → else match the user's words against `title`
   / `lastUserText` from the list → else ask which one. Ignore list entries
   whose `sessionId` or `tmuxTarget` is null; they cannot be read/driven reliably.
   If `~/.lfg/active-session` points at a session that is absent from the
   current driveable list, treat the pointer as stale and choose from the list.
2. **Act**: use `/messages?full=1` when answering history/context questions,
   checking what was already decided, or briefing yourself before steering a
   session. Use `/messages?limit=20` only for a quick live status check. Use
   `send` to instruct; `interrupt` to stop or redirect; `new`/`close` to manage
   lifecycle.
3. **Confirm** in one line ("Sent. The auth session is running the tests now.").
4. Update the focus pointer whenever the working session changes.

## Cautions

- **Don't act on your own session.** You (the voice orchestrator) appear in the list
  too — your session runs in the lfg repo cwd and has the orchestrator brief. Never
  `send`/`interrupt`/`close` yourself. If unsure which is you, ask before closing
  anything.
- `send` is **queued and steers** — it interrupts the running turn and feeds your
  text as the next instruction. Use `interrupt` alone to just stop.
- A session with no `tmuxTarget` is a ghost (orphaned transcript) — skip it.
- Reads are cheap; prefer a quick `/messages` check over guessing.
